# üéõÔ∏è Signal Generator

Small interactive C++ program that converts digital or analog input into common line-coded waveforms and visualizes them using OpenGL/GLUT.

## Features

- Line coding: NRZ-L, NRZ-I, Manchester, Differential Manchester, AMI ‚úÖ
- Scrambling for AMI: B8ZS, HDB3 ‚úÖ
- Modulation helpers: PCM (uniform quantization), Delta Modulation (DM) ‚úÖ
- Visualization: real-time waveform rendering with OpenGL/GLUT ‚úÖ
- Small analytical tools: longest palindrome (Manacher‚Äôs algorithm), longest zero sequence detection ‚úÖ

## Prerequisites

- MinGW g++ (or other C++ compiler compatible with Windows)
- FreeGLUT 3.0.0 (or compatible GLUT implementation)
- OpenGL (standard on Windows via Windows SDK)

Make sure your environment can find FreeGLUT headers and libraries when compiling.

## Installation (Windows) ‚Äî FreeGLUT setup

Option A ‚Äî MSYS2 / pacman (recommended if you use MSYS2):

1. Install MSYS2: https://www.msys2.org/
2. Open MSYS2 MinGW64 shell and run:

```powershell
pacman -Syu
pacman -S mingw-w64-x86_64-toolchain mingw-w64-x86_64-freeglut
```

3. Use the MinGW-w64 `g++` from MSYS2 to compile.

Option B ‚Äî Manual FreeGLUT installation:

1. Download FreeGLUT binaries (or build from source): https://freeglut.sourceforge.net/
2. Copy `freeglut.h` to your compiler includes (e.g. `C:\MinGW\include\GL\`)
3. Copy `libfreeglut.a` / `freeglut.lib` to your lib folder (e.g. `C:\MinGW\lib\`)
4. Copy `freeglut.dll` to the same folder as the compiled executable, or to `C:\Windows\System32` (or add its path to PATH).

After installation, verify `#include <GL/glut.h>` resolves and the linker finds `-lfreeglut`.

## Compilation

Use this command in PowerShell (assuming `g++` and FreeGLUT are available):

```powershell
g++ -o signal_generator.exe signal_generator.cpp -lfreeglut -lopengl32 -lglu32
```

Notes:
- If your FreeGLUT library is named differently (e.g., `-lglut`), adjust the flag.
- If headers/libs are in non-standard locations, add `-I` and `-L` flags:

```powershell
g++ -I"C:\path\to\freeglut\include" -L"C:\path\to\freeglut\lib" -o signal_generator.exe signal_generator.cpp -lfreeglut -lopengl32 -lglu32
```

## Usage Examples

Run the program from PowerShell:

```powershell
.\signal_generator.exe
```

Example interactive session (user input shown after prompts):

- Program: "1. Digital Input\n2. Analog Input (PCM/DM)\nChoice: "
- User: `1` (Digital)
- Program: "Binary data: "
- User: `0011000011110000`
- Program prints longest palindrome, then prompts for encoding:
- Program: "1. NRZ-L\n2. NRZ-I\n3. Manchester\n4. Diff Manchester\n5. AMI\nChoice: "
- User: `3` (Manchester)

Output (console):

```
=== Digital Signal Generator ===
... (prompts) ...
Longest Palindrome: 000011110000 (Length: 12)
Signal: 1 -1 -1 1 ...  (waveform sample values printed)
OpenGL window opened. Close to exit...
```

When Manchester is selected the displayed waveform sample length will be double the bit-length (mid-bit transitions are shown). Close the OpenGL window to quit the program.

## Sample: PCM input -> PCM bits

If you choose Analog Input (PCM) and supply 4 samples `0.1 0.2 0.4 0.9` with 2 bits/sample the program will quantize into 4 levels and print a resulting bitstring like `00 01 10 11` concatenated as `00011011` (actual output depends on min/max scaling).
